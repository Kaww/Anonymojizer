# ðŸ˜ƒ Anonymojizer
Anonymize people in photos by replacing their faces by emojis.

## How to use it ?
1. Pick a photo from the gallery
2. Choose an emoji
3. The anonymization process will detect people's faces and replace them by the selected emoji
4. Export your new photo to the gallery

## How it works ?
I'm using Apple's Vision framework to process the photos and detect faces (read [Apple developer documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision)).
